Scripts and stuff for Scouting

## hoac-camps

These scripts transform the hoac-camps spreadsheet into other formats.
The CamperSchedules.xlsx must first be saved as CSV. Unfortunately MS Excel requires you to save each sheet individually. Mac Numbers creates a folder and saves each sheet into a separate file.

* `manycsv2toteboard.rb` - builds a camper schedule that can be printed as a large tote board for easy viewing in camp.
